00:00:00.340 We begin in the middle of the 19th century.
00:00:03.520 In Europe, the rise of nationalism underminesthe dominant powers.
00:00:07.900 The Kingdom of Sardinia, allied to France, defeats the Austrian empire and obtains Italian unification.
00:00:15.120 Prussia, which eyes the German confederation,
00:00:18.040 also defeats the Austrians to create the North German Confederation.
00:00:22.580 5 years later, it allies with the southernGerman states,
00:00:26.464 defeats France and obtains the creation of the German Empire which is proclaimed in Versailles.
00:00:33.250 The new country takes over Alsace Lorraine.
00:00:36.000 To discourage French revenge attacks, Germany moves diplomatically closer to Austria-Hungary and Russia.
00:00:43.080 And it rapidly develops its industry and army.
00:00:46.460 In the southeast of the continent, insurgenciesthreaten the Ottoman Empire.
00:00:51.200 Russia, its historical enemy, takes advantageof the situation and after a war
00:00:56.740 sparks the independence of Balkan states, and seizes territories.
00:01:01.300 However, Russia’s rising status is frownedupon by Western powers,
00:01:06.100 who meet in Berlin to review the treaty.
00:01:08.960 This worsens Russian public opinion aboutGermany.
00:01:12.640 The latter then signs a defensive militaryalliance with Austria-Hungary.
00:01:17.400 Italy joins the alliance, after France seizesTunisia, which it long covets.
00:01:23.060 The three parties form the Triplice or theTriple Alliance.
00:01:31.340 Germany, now a major power, embarks upon acolonial policy.
00:01:36.240 The country brings together European powers in Berlin
00:01:39.260 to establish rules around colonization, then seizes territories in Africa and Asia.
00:01:45.740 This causes friction with the British andFrench colonial empires.
00:01:51.020 Faced with growing German power, France andRussia sign a secret military alliance.
00:01:56.620 France then obtains from Italy a secret treatyof neutrality,
00:02:01.060 which would avoid it having to manage a second front in the event of war.
00:02:06.229 The United Kingdom also feels threatened byGermany’s rise,
00:02:09.888 especially by its military fleet which can compete with its Royal Navy.
00:02:15.560 Moreover, Germany moves diplomatically closerto the Ottoman Empire,
00:02:20.289 notably by building a railway line to link Berlin to Baghdad and facilitating access to Mesopotamian oil,
00:02:27.780 coveted by the British Empire.
00:02:30.540 France, the United Kingdom and Russia thensign a military alliance and create the Triple Entente.
00:02:41.440 The alliances risk dragging the entire continentinto war.
00:02:45.480 Major powers embark upon an arms race andprepare military plans.
00:02:50.280 In the south east of the continent, the OttomanEmpire is weakened by a revolution.
00:02:55.500 Austria-Hungary takes advantage and annexesBosnia and Herzegovina.
00:03:00.500 This move is opposed by Russia, and especially Serbia which dreams of uniting the Slavic peoples of the South.
00:03:07.880 Then, two Balkan wars push the Ottoman Empireto the borders of the continent.
00:03:13.220 On June 28, 1914 in Sarajevo, the heir tothe Austrian throne François-Ferdinand
00:03:20.060 and his wife are assassinated by a bosnian Serb nationalist.
00:03:24.840 Austria-Hungary accuses Serbia of having organizedthe attack.
00:03:29.080 Russia defends Serbia, while Germany, nowthe world's leading military power,
00:03:34.000 supports its Austro-Hungarian ally.
00:03:41.440 On July 28, Austria-Hungary declares war onSerbia.
00:03:46.220 Russia reacts by decreeing a general mobilisation of its troops, triggering Germany to launch its military plan.
00:03:53.720 To avoid having to fight simultaneously ontwo fronts,
00:03:57.062 Germany plans to quickly defeat France by bypassing its armies by launching a surprise attack from the north.
00:04:04.060 It would then focus on Russia, whose troopswould take more time to mobilize.
00:04:08.860 Germany declares war on Russia, invades Luxembourgand issues an ultimatum to Belgium, demanding
00:04:15.180 right of passage for its troops.
00:04:17.540 Belgium refuses insisting upon its neutrality.
00:04:21.180 The following day, Germany declares war onFrance and launches the offensive.
00:04:26.280 The United Kingdom, which guarantees Belgianneutrality, in turn declares war on Germany
00:04:31.840 and sends its troops to France.
00:04:34.140 In a few days, all European powers, as wellas Montenegro, go to war.
00:04:39.060 Only Italy remains neutral at this stage.
00:04:45.900 In Asia, Japan -- which is allied with theUnited Kingdom -- declares war on Germany
00:04:51.120 and prepares for an invasion of its coloniesin China and the north Pacific Ocean.
00:04:56.920 On the eastern front, Russia launches itsoffensive earlier than Germany expects
00:05:01.940 but fails to gain ground in East Prussia, while further south, Austria-Hungary retreats.
00:05:08.190 In the West, the Allied armies cannot holdback the German advance.
00:05:12.470 The Franco-British armies retreat to Marnewhere they reorganize,
00:05:16.260 while the French government flees the capital to take refuge in Bordeaux.
00:05:21.080 But the first German army holding the flankpivots away from Paris
00:05:24.960 to join with the second army and continue surrounding Allied forces.
00:05:29.580 The Parisian reserve army attacks furthernorth, stopping in its tracks the German advance.
00:05:35.420 With this breach in the ranks, Allied forcesrush in and force a German retreat.
00:05:40.620 This is the failure of the Schlieffen plan.
00:05:44.300 When the front stabilizes, the two camps attempt to outflank each other and embark upon a race to the sea.
00:05:51.640 For Germany, it is also a question of isolating Belgium
00:05:55.420 and seizing ports where British reinforcements and supplies land.
00:06:00.210 The Belgian army barely succeeds in joiningthe deadlocked warfront.
00:06:04.510 Networks of trenches are dug on both sides for about 700km between the North Sea and the Swiss border.
00:06:16.760 Now that the Western front is frozen, bothsides use full force to attack the enemy:
00:06:22.060 the war becomes total.
00:06:24.180 The mighty Royal Navy imposes a naval blockadeon Germany,
00:06:28.600 while German submarines are sent to British waters to sink all ships and vessels.
00:06:34.550 Aviation, which is still a recent invention,is first used for observations.
00:06:39.890 Planes would then gradually be used for bombingand air combat.
00:06:44.200 The Germans use zeppelin airships to bombParis twice and England around 50 times.
00:06:50.340 Both sides use lethal gases to attack theenemy in the trenches.
00:06:55.000 Behind the frontlines, entire populationsparticipate in the war effort,
00:06:59.620 including women who are involved in arms factories.
00:07:03.560 Around the world, European colonies and Britishdominions are engaged in war.
00:07:08.660 They seize German colonies and supply largereinforcements of soldiers to the frontlines.
00:07:18.020 On the Eastern Front, Russia is in troublewith Austro-German troops.
00:07:22.640 The Ottoman Empire seizes the opportunityto go to war alongside the Central Powers.
00:07:28.420 A new front opens in the Caucasus as Britainlands an Indian army in Mesopotamia
00:07:34.180 with the goal to take the control of oil resources.
00:07:37.460 In reaction, the Central Powers launch anoffensive towards the Suez Canal
00:07:41.720 to cut supply lines from India, but are stopped in their advance.
00:07:46.400 In the Caucasus, after the failure of theOttoman offensive,
00:07:50.080 the government accuses the Armenian people of having supported Russia.
00:07:54.540 In retaliation, more than half of the Armenianpopulation would be massacred in what is today
00:08:00.420 recognized as genocide by 32 countries, butnot by Turkey.
00:08:05.560 To support geographically isolated Russia, Allies want to open a sea supply route via the Dardanelles Strait.
00:08:13.080 Franco-British ships enter the strait to bomb Ottoman forts,
00:08:17.060 but find the waters full of sea mines, forcing a retreat.
00:08:21.240 A month later, on April 25, Allies organizea military landing,
00:08:26.240 but Ottoman defenses hold steady, creating another deadlocked warfront.
00:08:35.280 During its submarine war, Germany sinks theBritish ship Lusitania
00:08:39.740 causing 1,200 civilian victims, including 128 US citizens.
00:08:46.500 The United States, officially neutral untilthat point, registers protest.
00:08:51.060 To prevent the US from going to war, Germanyslows its submarine warfare.
00:08:56.050 Italy, after negotiating with the Triple Ententeto annex new territories,
00:09:00.520 declares war on Austria-Hungary and launches an offensive around the Isonzo river.
00:09:06.360 On the Eastern Front, Russia completes itsretreat and stabilizes the battle front.
00:09:12.080 Bulgaria, which wishes to recover Balkan territories,joins the Central Powers.
00:09:17.240 Together with Austro-German forces, they invadeSerbia.
00:09:21.140 In reaction, the Allies violate the neutralityof Greece by using Salonica to land reinforcements
00:09:28.140 coming from fronts such as Dardanelles, whereOttoman victory is complete.
00:09:32.820 But it is too late for the overwhelmed Serbianarmy that flees via Albania.
00:09:38.340 Troops are landed on the island of Corfu,
00:09:40.940 from where they will be gradually brought back to the Macedonian front.
00:09:45.100 On the Western front, Germany launches a massiveoffensive in Verdun.
00:09:50.040 The German artillery pounds French trenches,which resists as best they can.
00:09:55.600 In the south of the continent, Portugal, allied with the United Kingdom, confiscates German ships in its ports.
00:10:02.780 In response, Germany declares war on Portugal,
00:10:05.760 who then sends troops to France and to its colonies in Africa,
00:10:10.000 where only German East Africa still resists the Allied offensives.
00:10:18.300 In Mesopotamia, the United Kingdom after losingits besieged army in Kut, seeks support in the region.
00:10:25.340 It secretly negotiates with France the partitionof Ottoman territories at the end of the war.
00:10:31.140 The two powers then support an Arab nationalist revolt which starts in Mecca by promising them independence.
00:10:38.800 In the North Sea, German and British fleetsface off in one of the largest naval battles in history.
00:10:45.760 Despite heavy losses on the British side,the Germans -- small in number --
00:10:50.440 during the night take refuge in their port.
00:10:53.440 While the Battle of Verdun is still ongoingand Italy is under pressure from Austria-Hungary,
00:10:59.300 Russia attempts to relieve its allies by launchinga massive offensive
00:11:03.780 that succeeds in piercing through opposition defenses.
00:11:08.020 In the West, another great offensive is launchedalong the Somme with Britain spearheading the attack.
00:11:14.460 They would use tanks for the first time, butto no avail.
00:11:22.040 While Romania joins the Entente, the Brusilovoffensive in the East,
00:11:26.000 and the battles of the Somme and Verdun,
00:11:28.720 all end after having caused tremendous human casualties on both sides.
00:11:33.420 Troops are exhausted and demoralized.
00:11:36.540 In Germany, the war effort and the Allied trade embargo prevent the country from getting enough food,
00:11:42.580 causing widespread famine.
00:11:44.700 Western powers, on the other hand, can counton a supply of resources via the Atlantic,
00:11:50.100 mainly from the United States, towards whomthey are in debt.
00:11:54.580 In response, Germany relaunches unrestrictedsubmarine warfare,
00:11:58.960 with the objective of sinking all commercial and military ships.
00:12:03.190 In addition, Germany sends a telegram to Mexicooffering an alliance against the United States.
00:12:09.520 The message is intercepted by Britain and transmitted to the United States, which then prepares to go to war.
00:12:20.000 In Russia, the war effort exhausts the population,who revolt and cause the Tsar to abdicate.
00:12:26.620 A provisional government is put in place,which chooses to continue the war.
00:12:31.580 The United States in turn declares war onGermany,
00:12:34.520 but it would take several months for the first troops to join the frontlines.
00:12:39.320 Greece, which is under pressure from the Allies,joins the Entente.
00:12:43.660 In both camps, exhausted soldiers begin mutinies.
00:12:47.680 On the Isonzo front, 11 similar Italian offensivesyield little result at the cost of many lives,
00:12:54.720 further affecting troop morale.
00:12:56.730 Austro-German troops counterattack and pushback the front line.
00:13:01.340 At the gates of Gaza, after a victory, Britisharmies prepare to enter Palestine.
00:13:06.839 To gain the support of the Jewish community,
00:13:09.360 British prime minister Arthur Balfour publishes a statement addressing Lord Rothschild,
00:13:14.860 a leader of the British Zionist Federation, promising a state for Jewish people in Palestine.
00:13:21.040 In Russia, the Bolsheviks organize a secondrevolution and seize power.
00:13:25.820 They sign an armistice with Germany.
00:13:27.880 But after the breakdown of negotiations, warresumes.
00:13:32.020 Austro-German forces put the Russian armyout of action,
00:13:35.440 forcing the country to accept a peace treaty and recognize the independence of new states.
00:13:41.240 Russia then sees the start of a civil war.
00:13:47.700 With Russia out of the game,
00:13:49.480 Germany concentrates on the Western front to win before US troops grow in strength.
00:13:55.000 A large-scale offensive is launched lasting 4 months, and German troops push their way to Marne again.
00:14:01.680 But a powerful Allied counter offensive forcesGerman troops to retreat.
00:14:06.560 In parallel, the Allies launch an offensive on the Macedonian front
00:14:10.720 which quickly forces Bulgaria to sign an armistice.
00:14:14.560 The Ottoman Empire finds itself isolated,while Arab-British forces reach Damascus,
00:14:20.180 as the French land in Beirut.
00:14:22.560 Austria-Hungary retreats to the Balkans andto Italy.
00:14:26.240 The empire is also weakened by minority separatistswho proclaim their independence.
00:14:32.020 The Ottoman Empire, followed by Austria-Hungary,sign an armistice with the Entente.
00:14:37.620 In Germany, sailors refuse to fight the Royal Navy and start a mutiny which turns into a popular revolt.
00:14:44.820 The Kaiser is forced to abdicate, and Germany’snew government requests an armistice
00:14:49.940 which is signed on November 11, 1918.
00:14:57.080 Over a period of 6 months, victors of thewar meet in Paris to draw up peace treaties
00:15:02.860 without inviting Bolshevik Russia who signeda separate peace treaty with Germany.
00:15:08.360 The United States proposes a peace plan whichincludes the creation of the League of Nations.
00:15:14.249 The United Kingdom and especially France,whose northern territory is devastated,
00:15:18.820 want to weaken Germany and make it pay heavy reparations.
00:15:23.200 June 28, 1919 proves to be a symbolic datebecause 5 years after the assassinations at Sarajevo,
00:15:30.540 a peace treaty is signed betweenGermany and the Allies at Versailles,
00:15:35.120 in the same room where the German Empire had beenproclaimed in 1871.
00:15:40.520 The measures imposed on Germany are severe.
00:15:43.120 The country loses 20% of its territory and10% of its population,
00:15:48.140 mainly to the benefit of Poland which is recreated and which obtains access to the sea.
00:15:53.940 Germany is cut in two while the Saar region, rich in coal, is brought under international control for 15 years.
00:16:01.320 German colonies are carved up among the victors.
00:16:04.520 The country's army is severely dismantled.
00:16:07.680 Finally, Germany and its allies are considered solely responsible for war damages
00:16:12.940 and must pay all reparations.
00:16:15.460 The treaty is considered a humiliation bythe German people.
00:16:22.860 Austria-Hungary is completely dismantled.
00:16:25.790 Czechoslovakia and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croatsand Slovenes are created.
00:16:31.009 Italy feels aggrieved as it does not obtainall the territories it was promised.
00:16:35.889 Austria, which is entirely German-speaking,is denied the right to be attached to Germany.
00:16:41.790 The Ottoman Empire is also dismembered duringthe Treaty of Sèvres.
00:16:46.180 The UK struggles to keep its word, havingpromised land to the French, the Zionist Jews,
00:16:51.520 and independence to the Arabs.
00:16:54.200 The Turks refuse the treaty and take up armsagain.
00:16:57.280 They gain some territories, then sign in Lausannea treaty fixing the new borders of Turkey.
00:17:06.960 The First World War -- or the so-called GreatWar --
00:17:10.236 was then the deadliest ever, with just under 18 million dead, including 8 million civilians.
00:17:17.050 The weakened population was then hit hardby the deadly Spanish flu pandemic.
00:17:22.549 Economically, European powers find themselvesheavily indebted,
00:17:26.720 to the benefit of neutral countries and the United States,
00:17:30.080 which strengthens its status as the leading economic power.
00:17:34.260 Russia becomes the USSR, a country exhausted by war and frustrated by the loss of many European territories.
00:17:42.460 In Palestine, tensions mount between Arabsand the Zionist Jews who migrate there.
00:17:48.200 The new European borders disgruntle many.
00:17:51.320 The fact that some German populations arenow living in Poland and Czechoslovakia
00:17:56.160 would contribute to the outbreak of the Second World War.
